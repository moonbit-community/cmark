<h2>Math</h2>
<p>The inline \(\sqrt{x^2-1}\) equation.</p>
<p>There must be no blanks after the opener and before the closer. This
makes so you can donate $5 or $10 dollars here and there without problem.</p>
<p>There is no such think as nesting \(\sqrt{x^2-1}\)+3\(+3\). As usual
delimiters can be $escaped$ \(\sqrt{16\$}\)</p>
<p>Amazing, this is <a href="https://example.org">hyperlinked math \(3x^2\)</a></p>
<p>The HTML renderer should be careful with \(a &lt; b\) escapes.</p>
<p>Display math can be in <code>math</code> code blocks.</p>
\[
\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 &lt; \Phi
\]
<p>But it can also be in \[ \left( \sum_{k=1}^n
a_k b_k \right)^2 &lt; \Phi \]</p>
